Yubo Liu received his Ph.D. degree of computer science and technology from Sun Yat-sen University in 2021 (advised by [Prof. Yutong Lu](https://pages.github.com/)). He is also a joint Ph.D student at Arizona State University (advised by [Prof. Ming Zhao](https://pages.github.com/)). 

He is dedicated to the research of storage system and high performance computing. The main focus of his research is to improve storage performance in large-scale distributed systems (e.g., TIANHE-II supercomputer) through non-volatile memory and optimized consistency mechanism. His works have been published in some well-known academic conferences and journals (IPDPS, ICCD, Cluster Computing, etc), and some of them have been open sourced in his Github. He has extensive engineering experience and has independently designed and implemented several storage systems. He has served as an external reviewer for some academic conferences, including ATC, ICCD, and ICAC.
