Dr. Yubo Liu is a research engineer at Huawei OS kernel Lab. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from [National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou](http://www.nscc-gz.cn/) at Sun Yat-sen University in 2021, advised by [Prof. Yutong Lu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2483). He is also a joint Ph.D. student of [VISA Lab](http://visa.lab.asu.edu/web/about/) at Arizona State University, advised by [Prof. Ming Zhao](http://visa.lab.asu.edu/web/people/mingzhao/). His research direction is storage system and high performance computing, including but not limited to distributed/local file system, object storage system, persistent memory, and consistency. His works have been published on some well-known academic conferences and journals (IPDPS, ICCD, Cluster Computing, etc).
